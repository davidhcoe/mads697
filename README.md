# Upward Mobility Streamlit App
This app is a component of the [Upward Mobility](http://upwardmobility.pythonanywhere.com/) web site. 

This app presents the data findings from the research done for the Upward Mobility capstone project. See the [blog](http://upwardmobility.pythonanywhere.com/blog) on the Upward Mobility site to learn more.

## How this app works

- When the app starts, `main.py` is run. This file is resonsible for sorting which page the user intends to target based on the url parameters.
- `national.py` presents the national map with overview statistics
- `county_details.py` presents a breakdown of the county to view the details of each Upward Mobility domain
